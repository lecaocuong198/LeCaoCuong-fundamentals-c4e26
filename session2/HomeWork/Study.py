#1
#the Boolean data type is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false)
#
#For example:
#(x>=5)
#(x!=0)
#(x<=9)
#
#
#3
#One conditional can also be nested within another.
#
#for example:
#if x < y:
#    print("x is less than y")
#else:
#   if x > y:
#        print("x is greater than y")
#    else:
#        print("x and y must be equal")
